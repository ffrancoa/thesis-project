# Thesis: Stochastic Analysis of Soil Variability Effects on the Seismic Response of a Tailings Storage Facilit

I decided to create this repository to document the full development of my grad
thesis, including code, data, results, and manuscript written in Typst using the
`cmarker` package. The main purpose of doing this is to train my skills in Git and
Typst, and also to give a kind of template for anyone interested in doing something
similar.

My thesis is written in Spanish, but the code and all other stuff are in English. At
the end of the project I will translate my manuscript to English in this same
repository.

- Original title (in Spanish): Análisis Numérico-Estocástico del Impacto de la
  Variabilidad Espacial del Suelo de Cimentación en la Estabilidad Física y la
  Respuesta Sísmica de un Depósito de Relaves
- Authors: Francesco F. (main researcher), Franklin O. & Denys P (mentors).
- University: National University of Engineering (Lima, Perú)

This research project was sponsored by the Civil Engineering Faculty Research Center
of the same university (IIFIC-UNI), and the authors deeply acknowledge it support.
